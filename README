CoverageTasks
=============

Rake tasks for running rcov in rails


Installation
============

git clone git://github.com/aaron/coverage_tasks.git coverage_tasks

I recommend installing the spicycode version of rcov before running these tasks.
http://github.com/spicycode/rcov/tree/master

sudo gem install spicycode-rcov --source=http://gems.github.com/


Example
=======

rake coverage:units
rake coverage:functionals
rake coverage:all
